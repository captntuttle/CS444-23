			The I/O scheduler exists in order to handle the efficient use of processor resources that way developers do not have to. An elevator algorithm and NOOP implementation are already provided. Using these we developed an SSTF implementation using the LOOK algorithm.
	\end{abstract}
\end{titlepage}

\section{Project Design}
Since we needed to implement our solution based off the current NOOP system, we had to take a look at that. We also looked at LOOK which was required from the assignment and realized it fixed the starvation that SSTF would have. The solution is based off of an elevator algorithm where the program goes up and down from top to bottom and back again through the requests. The order of the requests is determined by the implemented LOOK algorithm.

\section{Project Questions}
\subsection{What do you think the main point of this assignment is?}
We think the main point of this assignment was to further our knowledge about the kernel and specifically how the I/O scheduler works. I also think it helped to increase our knowledge of the various algorithms that go into making it work. This assignment also helped in finally modifying the actual kernel rather than just compiling and running it.

\subsection{How did you personally approach the problem?}
Our approach was fairly simple. First we brought in the implementation of NOOP to start with and also added in an elevator using elevator.h. Then we changed it around in order to implement SSTF and use the LOOK algorithm. Afterwards, we just compiled and ran the kernel with well placed print statements to show it working.

\subsection{How did you ensure your solution was correct?}
First in order to make sure our implementation was correct we focused on getting the kernel to actually build properly. After it was able to build we added in different print statements to let us be able to see it actually running. After we felt we had enough print statements showing our function running, we decided it was done.

\subsection{What did you learn?}
We learned how to manipulate the kernel a little better as well as manipulating the I/O scheduler. We also learned various algorithms throughout the process of completing this assignment.

\subsection{How should the TA test your program?}

\section{Work Log}
\subsection{Kristen Patterson}
I started work on Sunday the 24th by starting the implementation and finishing most of the elevator algorithm as well as incorporation of the NOOP implementation. Then on Saturday I included the Makefile for the low-level kernel as well as fixed a slight error I saw in the program. On Monday I did some restructuring of the directories and added the writeup for the assignment.
