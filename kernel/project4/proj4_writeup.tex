\section{Work Log}
\subsection{Kristen Patterson}
I started working November 30, after Ken had initially started the file.
I worked most of the day finishing up what he had started and when I was done I started on the first-fit slob.
I had finished most of the first-fit leaving the rest for Ken to sweep up and debug.

\subsection{Ken Steinfeldt}
I created the assignment and outline around the 28th.
I started most of the best-fit slob on the 29th.
On the 30th I came back in to finish the assignment and debugs.
Then on the first I added in all the supplementary testing files.
